# Project Statement
(Extension of the easy part) Everything was going fine for Shivansh but then Anshumaan came into the room and saw the fallen presents. As a physics lover, he wanted to understand the different patterns and boundaries of the fallen items for his upcoming paper on entropy. He wants you to give information about the boundaries of each fallen gift. Do this by returning the coordinates of the points that are located exactly on the boundary.

Note: - Please ensure that the enclosing polygon is convex. The points on the said polygon need to be coordinates of the boundary items for that hamper. - Make sure to handle the input in the same order as given. (consider the bottom left as the origin)

Input Format

m rows
n columns
k hampers
m * n matrix

Constraints

1 <= m <= 100
1 <= n <= 100
1 <= k < 15

Output Format

Sorted K points that exist on the boundary of the enclosed polygon (sorted primarily with respect to x and secondarily with respect to y) in the format x y
